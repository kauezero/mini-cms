# Mini CMS

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

### Description

**Mini CMS** is a basic content management system built with Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. It allows an admin to create, edit, and delete posts, which are then displayed publicly on the main site. Each post belongs to a category, and users can browse posts filtered by category.

The admin area is accessible at `/admin`, but only pre-authorized users can log in. Public registration is disabled to reflect a typical CMS workflow where admin accounts are managed manually.
